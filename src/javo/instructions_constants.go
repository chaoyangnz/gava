ldc

== Operation

Push item from run-time constant pool

== Format

ldc
index

== Forms

ldc = 18 (0x12)

== Operand Stack

... →

..., value

== Description

The index is an unsigned byte that must be a valid index into the run-time constant pool of the current class (§2.6).
The run-time constant pool entry at index either must be a run-time constant of type int or float, or a reference to a
string literal, or a symbolic reference to a class, method type, or method handle (§5.1).

If the run-time constant pool entry is a run-time constant of type int or float, the numeric value of that run-time
constant is pushed onto the operand stack as an int or float, respectively.

Otherwise, if the run-time constant pool entry is a reference to an instance of class String representing a string
literal (§5.1), then a reference to that instance, value, is pushed onto the operand stack.

Otherwise, if the run-time constant pool entry is a symbolic reference to a class (§5.1), then the named class is
resolved (§5.4.3.1) and a reference to the Class object representing that class, value, is pushed onto the operand stack.

Otherwise, the run-time constant pool entry must be a symbolic reference to a method type or a method handle (§5.1).
The method type or method handle is resolved (§5.4.3.5) and a reference to the resulting instance of
java.lang.invoke.MethodType or java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle, value, is pushed onto the operand stack.

== Linking Exceptions

During resolution of a symbolic reference to a class, any of the exceptions pertaining to class resolution (§5.4.3.1)
can be thrown.

During resolution of a symbolic reference to a method type or method handle, any of the exception pertaining to method
type or method handle resolution (§5.4.3.5) can be thrown.

== Notes

The ldc instruction can only be used to push a value of type float taken from the float value set (§2.3.2) because a
constant of type float in the constant pool (§4.4.4) must be taken from the float value set.

== Operand Stack

== Description

The unsigned indexbyte1 and indexbyte2 are assembled into an unsigned 16-bit index into the run-time constant pool of
the current class (§2.6), where the value of the index is calculated as (indexbyte1 << 8) | indexbyte2. The index must
be a valid index into the run-time constant pool of the current class. The run-time constant pool entry at the index
either must be a run-time constant of type int or float, or a reference to a string literal, or a symbolic reference to
a class, method type, or method handle (§5.1).

If the run-time constant pool entry is a run-time constant of type int or float, the numeric value of that run-time
constant is pushed onto the operand stack as an int or float, respectively.

During resolution of a symbolic reference to a method type or method handle, any of the exception pertaining to method
type or method handle resolution (§5.4.3.5) can be thrown.

== Notes

The ldc_w instruction is identical to the ldc instruction (§ldc) except for its wider run-time constant pool index.

The ldc_w instruction can only be used to push a value of type float taken from the float value set (§2.3.2) because a

The unsigned indexbyte1 and indexbyte2 are assembled into an unsigned 16-bit index into the run-time constant pool of

== Notes

Only a wide-index version of the ldc2_w instruction exists; there is no ldc2 instruction that pushes a long or double
with a single-byte index.

The ldc2_w instruction can only be used to push a value of type double taken from the double value set (§2.3.2) because
